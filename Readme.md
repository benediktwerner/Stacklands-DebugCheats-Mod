# Stacklands DebugCheats Mod

Adds various (configurable) debug cheats to make testing stuff easier:

- Month never ends (can also be changed to a custom length instead)
- Villagers don't need food anymore
- Press F1 to open the card spawn menu (instead of K+O+F1 in vanilla)
- When hovering over the card spawn menu, press a letter to jump to cards starting with the name
- Press F2 to spawn 5 coins
- Press C while hovering over a card to duplicate it
- Press Delete to delete the card below the cursor and its children
- Hold Shift+Delete to continuously delete cards the cursor touches

To configure or disable the cheats, edit the `BepInEx/config/de.benediktwerner.stacklands.debugcheats.cfg` file which appears after starting the game once.

See also the HigherSidebar mod to increase the height of the card spawn menu.
